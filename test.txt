 noble prize

    It is a string within entity, so no lexical entry and supposed to an entity

         "string" : "Did Tesla win a nobel prize in physics?" here property dbo:award is win, I can make noun lexical entry 'nobel prize of' with dbo:award but then it will not match with gold sparql and may not help in your case to get True positive.

 ASK WHERE { res:Nikola_Tesla dbo:award res:Nobel_Prize_in_Physics }"

    War

It is a string within entity, so no lexical entry and supposed to an entity

      "string" : "What was the final result of the War of the Roses?", I can make a lexical entry 'war of' with dbo:battle but then it will not match with gold sparql and may not help in your case to get True positive.

     SELECT DISTINCT ?result WHERE { ?uri dbo:isPartOfMilitaryConflict dbr:Wars_of_the_Roses ; dbo:result ?result ; dbo:date ?date } ORDER BY DESC(?date) OFFSET 0 LIMIT 1"

Do you think that helps to add those lexical entries?
