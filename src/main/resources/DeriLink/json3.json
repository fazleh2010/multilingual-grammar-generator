            "@value": "To qualify for Jobseeker’s Allowance (JA) you must satisfy a mean test. In a means test the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection examines all your sources of income to test if they fall below a certain level. If they fall below that level you will get Jobseeker’s Allowance. The amount of Jobseeker’s Allowance you get depends on your income level. In the means test for Jobseeker’s Allowance your household income is assessed. If you are married, in a civil partnership or cohabitating, the means of your spouse, civil partner or cohabitant are also taken into account. Sometimes a certain amount of income or income from particular sources is not taken into account. Income not taken into account is often referred to as an income disregard. The means test for Jobseeker’s Allowance can be a complex calculation. Here we look at some of the general items that are taken into account in the means test. The means test examines the following types of income: Cash income (including income from work) Property personally used Capital (savings and investments) and property not personally used Benefit and privilege from living with your parents."
